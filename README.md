# Calmhand's Simple Calculator
### About
---
This app is a simple calculator that can perform basic mathematical commands (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulous) with integers and decimals as values.
### Purpose
---
The purpose of this project was for me to **practice HTML/CSS, Javascript, and popular JS framework Vuejs, (Version 3)**. I wanted to build this app from scratch, with as little assistance as possible (aside from referencing documentation from Vue and MDN Web Docs).




## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
